- name: copy properties
  cron:
    name:  # not required. Description of a crontab entry or, if env is set, the name of environment variable. Required if C(state=absent). Note that if name is not set and C(state=present), then a new crontab entry will always be created, regardless of existing ones. This parameter will always be required in future releases.
    user:  # not required. The specific user whose crontab should be modified. When unset, this parameter defaults to using C(root).
    job:  # not required. The command to execute or, if env is set, the value of environment variable. The command should not contain line breaks. Required if C(state=present).
    state: absent # not required. choices: absent;present. Whether to ensure the job or environment variable is present or absent.
    cron_file:  # not required. If specified, uses this file instead of an individual user's crontab. If this is a relative path, it is interpreted with respect to I(/etc/cron.d). If it is absolute, it will typically be I(/etc/crontab). Many linux distros expect (and some require) the filename portion to consist solely of upper- and lower-case letters, digits, underscores, and hyphens. To use the C(cron_file) parameter you must specify the C(user) as well.
    backup: False # not required. If set, create a backup of the crontab before it is modified. The location of the backup is returned in the C(backup_file) variable by this module.

    disabled: False # not required. If the job should be disabled (commented out) in the crontab. Only has effect if C(state=present).
    env: False # not required. If set, manages a crontab's environment variable. New variables are added on top of crontab. C(name) and C(value) parameters are the name and the value of environment variable.
    insertafter:  # not required. Used with C(state=present) and C(env). If specified, the environment variable will be inserted after the declaration of specified environment variable.
